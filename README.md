# üç∑ Wine Quality Analysis using Hadoop, Hive, and Apache Spark

A Data Analytics project leveraging Big Data tools to analyze and compare red and white wine datasets. This project showcases a complete ETL and data analysis pipeline using:

- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- Apache Hive for SQL-based querying
- Apache Spark for processing
- Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualizations

## üìÅ Dataset

Wine Quality datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality).  
Contains physicochemical and quality ratings for red and white wines.

| Dataset                |
|------------------------|

### 1. Data Ingestion to HDFS

```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/ved/wine_data/red
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/ved/wine_data/white

hdfs dfs -put winequality-red.csv /user/ved/wine_data/red/
hdfs dfs -put winequality-white.csv /user/ved/wine_data/white/
```
